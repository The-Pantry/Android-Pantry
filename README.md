# Android-Pantry
This is the first and ORIGINAL copy with all the blank android files for the pantry Android Application
Here I will put all the instructions needed for our project like project Ideas and so forth:

Here is actually all the git commands we need to know at this point in time

pwd		-tells you where you are (folders)
cd ..		-goes back a(1) folder or location
cd ~		-goes to your "home" folder
cd ...		-goes to the desired ... folder if avalable in the current folder
clear		-clears the screen so it looks cleaner
ls		-lists everything in the folder you are in
ls -a		-not really sure nbut it does something...
ls -la		-lists everything(even hidden folders) DO NOT TOUCH HIDDEN FOLDERS!
help		-lists the help options
git config	-lists all the config options
git init	-creates a git repository out of the current file you are in
git --global 	-after global you can use all global commands like user.name ... to set the name
git add .	-this will add all changes to git project (.) means folder [into staging area]
git add		- after add make a space and then the name of the file you want to add
git commit -m	-this will commit the changes made in your git project and your git repostory after -m put "" and add a message.
git log		-will let you view your commit history add ( --author="the name of the author") to view just one person
git status	-this will get the current status or your directory (local only)
git diff	-this will show you the differences in your working copy and your repository
git rm 		-this will remove the file that you put after the rm with a space
git mv		-moves the file after the command to the file 1 space after the first file




to rename a file you 
git add the new file name -> then git remove the old file after it has been renaimed in the file explorer.

or easier
to rename file 
git mv the file to the new file name
